# Books

This section is meant to be a way for me to keep track of what I've read, but feel free to look and see what books I enjoyed! And if you have any reccs, let me know!

The sections that are labelled with a year contain the books I read for that year, and then the sections where there's a title are some quotes/thoughts I may have had while reading the book.
None of the writing here was edited, so please don't judge typos, grammar, or any other stupid things I may have written there =)
